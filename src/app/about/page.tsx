      <p className="mt-4">
        Introducing "dtalk," an innovative application designed to revolutionize
        English learning through interactive chat with a chatbot. As the creator
        of this app, I intimately understand the challenges faced when lacking
        an environment for language practice. Learning a new language poses
        significant hurdles, inspiring the inception of this platform.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Currently in its developmental phase, dtalk embodies a single-member
        team. Expect glitches and imperfections along the way, which is why user
        contributions are invaluable. If you encounter bugs or desire additional
        features, your input will be crucial in refining the app's
        functionality.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Our mission extends beyond mere language learning. We aspire to foster a
        vibrant community where individuals support each other in practicing
        English. Embracing empathy for the shared struggle of mastering English,
        dtalk aims to bridge these learning gaps.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Your participation not only fuels the app's growth but also helps create
        a supportive ecosystem for language enthusiasts. Together, we strive to
        make language learning an enjoyable journey, overcoming obstacles
        collectively.
