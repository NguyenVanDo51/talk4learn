        {`Welcome to Talk4learn app, your personal English learning companion! Born from
        the challenges I faced while yearning to practice English without a
        suitable environment, Talk4learn is crafted to be a safe haven for language
        learners. I've been there, fighting the uphill battle to conquer a new
        language, and I know full well how daunting the task can seem. That's
        why Talk4learn isn't just an app; it's a realization of the idea that
        interactive learning can spark proficiency.`}

        glitches, and the application is still being polished. Your experiences,
